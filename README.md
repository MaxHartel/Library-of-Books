## Overview\
\
This program presents the user with a menu which allows the user to choose between many options on managing a digital library, as well as \
Supporting all of those options.From here the user can choose to add a book, print the library inventory, \
Delete a book from the library, read a book , or quit the program. \
\
## Reflection\
\
I loved this project. Throughout the course of this class I have started to enjoy coding more and more, as I start leaning more about the language of Java\
And coding projects become less about looking up syntax and more about figuring out how to solve problems using logic, the activity of coding just becomes\
more exiting to me.I thought this project was really cool because I think learning how to load and process files will be important going forward. The most \
challenging thing about this project was the scale of the project, it was difficult to make sure everything was working properly as the project progressed,\
But through a top to bottom method, I was able to get it done. \

\
## Compiling and Using\
\
To compile, execute the following command in the main project directory:\
```\
$ javac LibraryOfBooks.java\
```\
\
Run the compiled class with the command:\
```\
$ java LibraryOfBooks\
```\
\
You will be prompted with a menu that has directions on which keystrokes to press in order to explore different aspects of the program.\
